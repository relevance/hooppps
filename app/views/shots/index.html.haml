  %p 
    Hooppps was created by 
    %a{:href => '#'} Michael Parenteau 
    with the support of 
    %a{:href => '#'} Relevance. 
    Big thanks to 
    %a{:href => '#'} Jared Pace 
    for getting me up and running with the dev. Hooppps is built on Rails and uses the 
    %a{:href => '#'} swish 
    gem. The code is hosted on 
    %a{:href => '#'} github 
    and is ready for your design/dev love. 
  %p.copyright hooppps is in no way affiliated with dribbble but is obviously a huge fan!
